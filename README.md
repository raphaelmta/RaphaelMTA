## 🚀 What I Build

From scratch to scale, I create and deploy AI-powered solutions for business automation, data analysis, and intelligent decision-making.

### 🧠 Highlights of My Recent Projects:

- **🛠️ AI Proposal Generator**  
  Multi-agent system built with CrewAI and LangChain to analyze meeting transcripts and generate actionable business proposals.

- **🏢 Tornelli Internal Admin System**  
  Secure internal management platform built with Next.js, Notion API, and OpenAI, tailored for construction project coordination and communication.  
  Includes authentication, automated workflows, and real-time information handling.

- **🧬 Deep Learning in C++**  
  Handcrafted Convolutional Neural Network from scratch using modern C++20 – no dependencies, full performance, total control.  
  Built to deeply understand how neural networks work under the hood.

- **📊 Construction Tech Dashboard**  
  Power BI dashboard comparing traditional vs. modular construction using financial, environmental, and productivity KPIs.

- **📂 Document Digitization Pipeline**  
  Automation pipeline to convert physical archives into structured digital databases using Python, OCR, and ETL routines.

- **⚙️ Workflow Automations**  
  Development of integrated, scalable automations across platforms and APIs to streamline business operations and communication processes.
